## v0.5.1 - 2022-07-19

### Bug Fixes

- [codegen] fixes code generation for output types with large (200+) number of parameters hitting the JVM limits. Previously these types would generate compiling code but throw exceptions at runtime when in use. [#390](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/390)
- [codegen] fixes ambiguity in the "packages" option by adding a new "dependencies" option in Java extensions to Package Schema. With this change, both package name overrides and desired Maven dependencies in the generated build files can now be specified: [#739](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/739)
