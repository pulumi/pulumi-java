## 0.5.0 - 2022-07-13

### Improvements

- [runtime] Added health checks to `pulumi-language-java` so that it never leaks as an orphan process when the managing `pulumi` process terminates [#728](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/728)
- [codegen] Simplified publishing generated provider code to Maven Central. [#717](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/717)

### Bug Fixes

- [codegen] Fix a bug introduced in `0.4.1`. `gradle publish` stopped generating resources required by Pulumi and published broken packages. [#735](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/735)
