## 0.4.0 - 2022-06-22

### Improvements

- [codegen] **Breaking** : function invokes now accept `Output<T>` in their arguments and return `Output<T>` instead of `CompletableFuture<T>` [#163](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/163)
- [sdk] `Stack` resource is now considered internal and cannot be directly instantiated by the user. Instead of inheriting from `Stack`, please use the `Pulumi.run` form to define resources in your stack as shown in the README
- [sdk] support stack transformations with new `Pulumi.withOptions` API [#478](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/478)
- [runtime] Added Gradle support for subprojects. For example, given this directory structure: [#576](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/576)
