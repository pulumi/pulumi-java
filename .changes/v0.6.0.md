## v0.6.0 - 2022-09-13

### Bug Fixes

- [sdk] Remove the `get` prefix from getters in `Resource` class and inherited classes Old getters are preserved and marked deprecated. New getters: `urn`, `id`, `pulumiResourceType`, `pulumiResourceName`, `pulumiChildResources`. [#704](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/704)
- [sdk] Do not panic when the type of property in resource outputs does not match the one on the wire, while deserializing. The fix proceed with a null / default value and a warning in place of an error. [#643](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/643)
- [codegen] Fix code generation for exports with deeply nested generic types. Previously these types would generate compiling code but throw exceptions at runtime when in use. [#759](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/759)
- [runtime] The Pulumi CLI will no longer display seemingly duplicate stack traces. The language host was modified to hide error messages from an optional process of plugin discovery through classpath introspection. Also `plugin about` will no longer display errors from plugin discovery. To display errors from plugin discovery, use `-v=9` with a value of 1 or greater. [#785](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/785)
- [codegen] Fix import path for provider resources on `pulumi convert`. [#771](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/771)
- [sdk] Fix a bug that prevented user from specifying both parent and child aliases when refactoring component resources. [#778](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/778)
- [sdk] Fix a regression introduced after 0.5.2 when Pulumi Java SDK stopped tolerating missing fields from providers that manifested as InvocationTargetException caused by a NullPointerException. [#840](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/840)
