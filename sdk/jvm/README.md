# JVM Language Provider

JVM languages provider for Pulumi.


## Building and running

To build, you'll want to install the JDK 11 or greater, 
and ensure `java` is on your path. Once that it does, running `make` in either the root
directory or the `sdk/jvm` directory will build and install the language
plugin.

Once this is done, you can write a Pulumi app written on top of JVM.
