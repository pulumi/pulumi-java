/**
 * A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
 * that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
 * provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
 * instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
 * other network-related resources.
 * 
 * Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
 * global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
 * instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
 * private IP addresses.
 * 
 * Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
 * within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
 * a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
 * space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
 * When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
 * instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.
 * 
 * Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
 * instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
 * region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
 * of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.
 * 
 * To get more information about Subnetwork, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/subnetworks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Private Google Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access)
 *     * [Cloud Networking](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-vpc)
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ## Import
 * 
 * Subnetwork can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetwork:Subnetwork default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/subnetworks/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetwork:Subnetwork default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetwork:Subnetwork default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/subnetwork:Subnetwork default {{name}}
 * ```
