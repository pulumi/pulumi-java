/**
 * A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
 * when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
 * and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
 * like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.
 * 
 * Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
 * and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
 * present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
 * present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
 * Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
 * and import it to the provider when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
 * labels are required.
 * 
 * A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
 * accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
 * This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.
 * 
 * To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Notification Options](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options)
 *     * [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ## Import
 * 
 * NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:monitoring/notificationChannel:NotificationChannel default {{name}}
 * ```
