/**
 * Represents an Address resource.
 * 
 * Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
 * optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
 * the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
 * communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
 * you must specify the instance's external IP address.
 * 
 * Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
 * the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
 * the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
 * Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
 * static.
 * 
 * To get more information about Address, see:
 * 
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/beta/addresses)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network)
 *     * [Reserving a Static Internal IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ## Import
 * 
 * Address can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/addresses/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 * 
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/address:Address default {{name}}
 * ```
