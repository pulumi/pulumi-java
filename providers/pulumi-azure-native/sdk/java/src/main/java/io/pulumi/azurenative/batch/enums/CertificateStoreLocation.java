/**
 * The default value is currentUser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
