    /**
     * Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed. The default behavior is &#34;SourceResolution,&#34; which will keep the input video at its original resolution when analyzed. Using &#34;StandardDefinition&#34; will resize input videos to standard definition while preserving the appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize if the video is of higher resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360 before processing. Switching to &#34;StandardDefinition&#34; will reduce the time it takes to process high resolution video. It may also reduce the cost of using this component (see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics for details). However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be detected.
