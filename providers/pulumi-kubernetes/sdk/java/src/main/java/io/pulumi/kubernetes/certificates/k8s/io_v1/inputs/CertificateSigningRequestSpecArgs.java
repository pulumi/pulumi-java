     * expirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the issued certificate. The certificate signer may issue a certificate with a different validity duration so a client must check the delta between the notBefore and and notAfter fields in the issued certificate to determine the actual duration.
     * 
     * The v1.22+ in-tree implementations of the well-known Kubernetes signers will honor this field as long as the requested duration is not greater than the maximum duration they will honor per the --cluster-signing-duration CLI flag to the Kubernetes controller manager.
     * 
     * Certificate signers may not honor this field for various reasons:
     * 
     *   1. Old signer that is unaware of the field (such as the in-tree
     *      implementations prior to v1.22)
     *   2. Signer whose configured maximum is shorter than the requested duration
     *   3. Signer whose configured minimum is longer than the requested duration
     * 
     * The minimum valid value for expirationSeconds is 600, i.e. 10 minutes.
     * 
     * As of v1.22, this field is beta and is controlled via the CSRDuration feature gate.

     *   Requests for this signer can be auto-approved by the "csrapproving" controller in kube-controller-manager, and can be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager.
     *  3. "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" issues serving certificates that kubelets use to serve TLS endpoints, which kube-apiserver can connect to securely.

     *  4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key usages / extended key usages.
     *  5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is fixed by the signer, configurable by the admin.
     *  6. Whether or not requests for CA certificates are allowed.
