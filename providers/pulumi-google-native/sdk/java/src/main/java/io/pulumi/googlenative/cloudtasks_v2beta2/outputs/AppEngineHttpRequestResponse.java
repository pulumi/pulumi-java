For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed.

These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.
