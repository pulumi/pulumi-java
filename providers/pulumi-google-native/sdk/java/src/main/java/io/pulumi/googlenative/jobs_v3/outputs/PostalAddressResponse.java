The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large).

Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
