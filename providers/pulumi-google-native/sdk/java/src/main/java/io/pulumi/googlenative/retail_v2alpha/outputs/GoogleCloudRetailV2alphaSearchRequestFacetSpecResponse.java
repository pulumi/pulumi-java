Then the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how Google Retail Search orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that "price" and "brands" will always be ranked at 1st and 2nd position since their enable_dynamic_position are false.
