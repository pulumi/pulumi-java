    /**
     * An RRULE (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8.5.3) for how this window reccurs. They go on for the span of time between the start and end time. For example, to have something repeat every weekday, you'd use: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` To repeat some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow): `FREQ=DAILY` For the first weekend of every month: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU` This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you'd use something like: ```start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR``` Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ```start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA``` Note the start and end time's specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts. The FREQ values of HOURLY, MINUTELY, and SECONDLY are not supported.
