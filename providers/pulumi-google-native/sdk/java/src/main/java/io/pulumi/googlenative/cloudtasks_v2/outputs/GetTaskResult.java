The default deadline depends on the [scaling type](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling) of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps.
