Note that a value can be: - 'self' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the same security realm, which is currently but not guaranteed to be campus-sized) - 'self:metro' (i.e., clients that are in the same metro) - 'self:cloud-region' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the same cloud region) - 'self:prod-region' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the same prod region) - 'guardians' (i.e., allow connections from its guardian realms. See go/security-realms-glossary#guardian for more information.) - a realm (e.g., 'campus-abc') - a realm group (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see: go/realm-groups) A match is determined by a realm group membership check performed by a RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-howto). It is not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a realm, so realm conditions can only be used in a "positive" context (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
