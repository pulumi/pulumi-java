For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` * `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task; see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.
