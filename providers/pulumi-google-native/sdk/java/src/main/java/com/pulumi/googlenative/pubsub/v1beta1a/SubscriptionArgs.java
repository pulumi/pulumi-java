If a subscriber acknowledges after the deadline, the Pub/Sub system may accept the Ack, but it is possible that the message has been already delivered again.

While a message is outstanding (i.e. it has been delivered to a pull subscriber and the subscriber has not yet Acked or Nacked), the Pub/Sub system will not deliver that message to another pull subscriber (on a best-effort basis).
