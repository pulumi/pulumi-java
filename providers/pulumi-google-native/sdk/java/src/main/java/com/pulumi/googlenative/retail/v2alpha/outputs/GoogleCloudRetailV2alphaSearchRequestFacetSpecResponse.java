For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#39;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response will be determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &#34;rating&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &#34;price&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &#34;brands&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which will generate a facet &#39;gender&#39;. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be (&#34;price&#34;, &#34;brands&#34;, &#34;rating&#34;, &#34;gender&#34;) or (&#34;price&#34;, &#34;brands&#34;, &#34;gender&#34;, &#34;rating&#34;) depends on how Google Retail Search orders &#34;gender&#34; and &#34;rating&#34; facets. However, notice that &#34;price&#34; and &#34;brands&#34; will always be ranked at 1st and 2nd position since their enable_dynamic_position are false.
