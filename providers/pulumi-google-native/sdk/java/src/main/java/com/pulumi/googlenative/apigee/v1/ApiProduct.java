/**
 * Creates an API product in an organization. You create API products after you have proxied backend services using API proxies. An API product is a collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata that you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to your developer community. This metadata can include: - Scope - Environments - API proxies - Extensible profile API products enable you repackage APIs on the fly, without having to do any additional coding or configuration. Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to start testing your APIs. After you have authentication and authorization working against a simple API product, you can iterate to create finer-grained API products, defining different sets of API resources for each API product. **WARNING:** - If you don&#39;t specify an API proxy in the request body, *any* app associated with the product can make calls to *any* API in your entire organization. - If you don&#39;t specify an environment in the request body, the product allows access to all environments. For more information, see What is an API product?
