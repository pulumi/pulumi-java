/**
 * Note kind that represents a logical attestation &#34;role&#34; or &#34;authority&#34;. For example, an organization might have one `AttestationAuthority` for &#34;QA&#34; and one for &#34;build&#34;. This Note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached Attestation Occurrences, even if they don&#39;t all live in the same project.
