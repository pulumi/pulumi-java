If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 1. `min_nodes` must be at least 1 for use with a Compute Engine machine type.
