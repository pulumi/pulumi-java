/**
 * Creates a snapshot from the requested subscription. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. If the snapshot already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the requested subscription doesn&#39;t exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot would expire in less than 1 hour -- then `FAILED_PRECONDITION` is returned. See also the `Snapshot.expire_time` field. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
 * Auto-naming is currently not supported for this resource.
