They filter requests before they hit the origin servers. - CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE: Cloud Armor edge security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services (including Cloud CDN-enabled) as well as backend buckets (Cloud Storage). They filter requests before the request is served from Google&#39;s cache. - CLOUD_ARMOR_INTERNAL_SERVICE: Cloud Armor internal service policies can be configured to filter HTTP requests targeting services managed by Traffic Director in a service mesh. They filter requests before the request is served from the application. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
