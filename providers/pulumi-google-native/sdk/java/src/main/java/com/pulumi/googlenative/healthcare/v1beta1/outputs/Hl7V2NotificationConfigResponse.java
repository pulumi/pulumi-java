     * @return Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&#34;query text&#34;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&#34;Comment = great&#34;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#39;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = &#34;ADT&#34;`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset&#39;s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date &lt; &#34;2017-01-02&#34;`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34;`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time &lt; &#34;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&#34;`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = &#34;ABC&#34;`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(&#34;123456&#34;, &#34;MRN&#34;)`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.&#34;priority&#34;=&#34;high&#34;`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.&#34;priority&#34;:*`.
