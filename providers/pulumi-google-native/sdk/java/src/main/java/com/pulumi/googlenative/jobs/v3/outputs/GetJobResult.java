Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#39;ReqA&#39; becomes &#39;ReqA-1&#39;, &#39;ReqA-2&#39;, etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed.

It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience.

(For example, a Job with addresses &#34;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&#34; and &#34;London, UK&#34; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)
