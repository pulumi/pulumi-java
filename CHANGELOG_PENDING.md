### Improvements

- [sdk] [#829](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/829)
  Improve Javadoc comments in `CustomResourceOptions` and `ResourceOptions` classes.

- [sdk][codegen] [#704](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/704)
  remove prefix `get` from getters in Resource class and inherited classes
  Old getters are preserved and marked deprecated and will be deleted in the future.
  New getters: urn, id, pulumiResourceType, pulumiResourceName, pulumiChildResources.

- [sdk] [#643](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/issues/643):
  Do not panic when the type of property in resource outputs doesn't match
  the one on the wire, while deserializing.
  The fix proceed with a null / default value and a warning in place of an error.
  This makes some programs succeed.

- [codegen] [#759](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/759)
  fixes code generation for exports with deeply nested generic types.
  Previously these types would generate compiling code but throw
  exceptions at runtime when in use.

  Packages generated with this version of codegen will need to depend
  on this version of Java SDK or higher, so that user programs get the
  upgraded Java SDK that can understand the new export annotation
  scheme and continue working without changes.

- [cli] [#785](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/issues/785):
  The Pulumi CLI will no longer display, what look like a duplicate stack traces.
  The language host was modified to hide error messages from an optional process
  of plugin discovery through classpath introspection.
  Also `plugin about` will no longer display errors from plugin discovery.
  To display errors from plugin discovery, use config option `runtime.options.v`
  with a value of 1 or greater.


### Bug Fixes

- [codegen] [#771](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/issues/771):
  Fix import path for provider resources on `pulumi convert`.

- [sdk] Fixes a bug that prevented user from specifying both parent
  and child aliases when refactoring component resources.

- [sdk] Fixes a regression introduced after 0.5.2 when Pulumi Java SDK
  stopped tolerating missing fields from providers that manifested as
  InvocationTargetException caused by a NullPointerException.
