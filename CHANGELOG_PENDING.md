### Improvements

- [provider] [#728](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/pull/728):
  Added health checks to `pulumi-language-java` so that it never
  leaks as an orphan process when the managing `pulumi` process
  terminates

- [codegen] [#717](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/issues/717):
  Simplified publishing generated provider code to Maven Central.

  Added a `gradleNexusPublishPluginVersion` option that installs
  [gradle-nexus/publish-plugin](https://github.com/gradle-nexus/publish-plugin)
  in the build code generated by `pulumi-java-gen`.

  The option can also be activated on the command line during code
  generation: `pulumi-java-gen --build gradle-nexus`.

  This enables one-step publishing of generated Java packages via
  Sonatype's OSSRH Nexus:

  ```
  gradle publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- [codegen] [#735](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java/issues/735):
  Fix a bug introduced in `0.4.1`. `gradle publish` stopped generating
  resources required by Pulumi and published broken packages.
